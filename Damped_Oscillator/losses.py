"""
Loss functions for the damped spring-mass PINN.
Each function takes a model and the relevant tensors
as arguments. 

Contains:
    loss_data    -- MSE between predictions and noisy observations
    loss_physics -- mean squared ODE residual at collocation points
    loss_ic      -- squared error on initial position and velocity
